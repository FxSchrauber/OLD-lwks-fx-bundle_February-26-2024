# Lightworks user Fx library, December 18, 2021.


The effects in this ZIP file were created by Lightworks users - thank you to all who have contributed, especially khaver, who started things off.  They will run versions of Lightworks from 14.5 on, and may also run on versions earlier than that.

Use of these effects is simple:

1. Copy the FX file(s) that you need to your computer. Anywhere will do as long as you know where to find them..
2. Launch Lightworks, open a project, then open the Effects panel by clicking the F9 key.
3. Select the orange "+" symbol, and right click in the window displaying the Lightworks effects.
4. From the drop down menu that appears choose "Create template from .FX file..".
5. In the top left of the window that appears click on "Places" and navigate to the folder in which you stored the FX file.
6. Select the Fx file and then click OK.

The effect will be copied and a further window will appear giving details.

There is no checking in this library for effects with duplicate functionality. These are all included largely as supplied by the original creator. Some of the earlier effects may have been superseded by Editshare-supplied equivalents. It's up to you to check that any given effect does what you want, and does it better/faster/simpler than any alternative.

Lightworks does not overwrite existing effects but simply adds new ones to the list, even if they have the same name and category as a currently installed effect. If you want to replace an effect you need to destroy the existing version first. In the effects panel right-click on the effect you wish to change, and from the menu that appears, select "Destroy current effect". Then install your new version in the usual way. Note that you cannot delete effects supplied with Lightworks this way.

If you need to use two effects that have the same name, simply open one of them with any plain text editor (definitely not a word processor) and look for the line up near the top of the file that says something like ' string Description = "Effect name"; '. Type in your new name in place of the existing effect name inside the quotes and save the file. When you load that version it will now have the name that you gave it.

**NOTE:** Every attempt has been made to ensure that these effects will compile and run on any version of Lightworks on any supported operating system. If you have trouble installing them, please make a note of any error message that Lightworks gives you. Post the complete details [here](https://forum.lwks.com/threads/custom-and-user-effects-feedback.191071/). It will be followed up.
